=========================

An example of a custom iOS text-input component.

To make sure the source code is in a nice state (and easily diffable), we use [uncrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/).

Installing crustify is easiest using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):
	  brew install uncrustify
