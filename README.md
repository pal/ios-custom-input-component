ios-custom-input-component
=========================

An example of a custom iOS text-input component.

To make sure the source code is in a nice state (and easily diffable), we use [unrustify](http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/).

Installing crustify is easiest using [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/):
	brew install uncrustify
